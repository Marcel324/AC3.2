## AC3.2 - Week 1 - Homework

### I. Variables

#### Question 1.
Provide the following constants/variable names with the most appropriate type annotations.

1. let _firstName_: String
2. let _middleInitial_: Character
3. var _age_: Int
4. var _latitude_: Double
5. var _longitude_: Double
6. var _isRainingCurrently_: Bool
7. let _completeAddress_: String
8. let _π_: Double

#### Question 2.
Convert the following decimal numbers to Binary:
* 55 110111
* 122 in binary is 1111010
* -1 in binary is -01
* 15 in binary is 1111


#### Question 3.
Using nested loops, print the numbers from 0 to 100, then back to 0.


for case let x in 0...1 {
    if x==0 {
        for y in 0...100 {
            print(y)
        }
    } else {
        for y in (0...100).reverse() {
            print(y)
        }}}
#### Question 4.
While ```i``` is greater than 1, print only all positive even numbers and break 
out of the loop when you've reached 220.

var i = 2
while i>1 && i<221 {
        print(i)
    i+=2
}


#### Question 5.
* Using any kind of loop, print the sum of all numbers between 0 to 50.

outerloop: for x in 0...50 {
     innerloop: for y in 0...50 {print ("Sum of \(x) + \(y) = \(x+y) ")
 }}

* Using a while loop, print all the odd numbers from 0 to 100.
var i = 0
while i < 100 {
    i += 1
    if i%2==1 {
        print (i)
    }
    }

* Using a ```for case``` loop, print all the multiples of 10 from 50 to 500.

for case let i in 50...500 where i%10==0 {
    print(i)
}

#### Question 6.
Consider the code below. Loop through the ```professionals``` array and using a switch statement:
* Print out the professionals with _lastName_ "Smith".
* Print out all the developers.
* Print out all the non-developers.
* Print out the professionals in their 20s.
* Print out the professionals in their 30s.

```swift
let sarah = (firstName: "Sarah", lastName: "Palardo", job: "teacher", age: 32)
let beth = (firstName: "Beth", lastName: "Newell", job: "developer", age: 29)
let jana = (firstName: "Jana", lastName: "Smith", job: "developer", age: 33)
let lauren = (firstName: "Lauren", lastName: "Olson", job: "doctor", age: 27)
let charles = (firstName: "Charles", lastName: "Wong", job: "developer" , age: 24)
let steve = (firstName: "Steve", lastName: "Smith", job: "writer", age: 28)
let jamal = (firstName: "Jamal", lastName: "Smith", job: "developer", age: 25)
let navindra = (firstName: "Navindra", lastName: "Chowdhurry", job: "actuary", age: 29)

let professionals = [sarah, beth, jana, lauren, charles, steve, jamal, navindra]
```

/for person in professionals {
//    switch person {
//        case firstName = "Smith":
//        print("\(firstName)'s last name is Smith")
////        case job = "developer":
////        print("\(firstName) is a developer")
////        case job =! "developer":
////        print ("\(firstName) is not a developer")
////    case age in 20..<30:
////        print("\(firstName) is in their 20s")
////    case age in 30..<40:
////        print("\(firstName) is in their 30s")
//    default:
//            break
//    }
//}  Doesn't work. 


#### Question 7.
Given the arrays below, use nested loops to print out every possible card in the deck.

```swift
let denominations = ["A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"]
let suits = ["♠️", "♣️", "♥️", "♦️"]

for case let i in 0...suits.count-1 {
    for case let n in 0...denominations.count-1 {
        print(suits[i] ,denominations[n])
    }}

```

#### Question 8.
Print out the lyrics to the song ["99 Bottles of Beer"](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html)
* Hint 1: Use a for-loop and a switch statement
* Hint 2: Below is an example of reversing a range in Swift

```swift
var beers = true
for i in (1...99).reverse() {
    switch beers {
    case i > 1:
        print("\(i) bottles of beer on the wall, \(i) bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, \(i-1) bottles of beer on the wall.")
    case i == 1:
        print("\(i) bottle of beer on the wall, \(i) bottle of beer. Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.")
        fallthrough
    case i < 1:
        print("No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.")
    default:
        break
    }

```

#### Question 9.
##### "FizzBuzz"
* Create a loop that prints all integers from 0 to 100.
* For all multiples of 3, print out "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For all multiples of 5, print out "Buzz"  instead of the number.
* For all multiples of 3 and 5, print out "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

for i in 1...100 {
        if i%3==0 && i%5==0 {
    print("FizzBuzz")
    }; if i%5==0 {
        print("Buzz")
    } else if i%3==0 {
        print("Fizz")
    } else {
        print(i)
    }
}


#### Question 10.
Write code that will print out the first 10 [Fibonacci](http://www.codeforwin.in/2015/06/fibonacci-series-in-c-program.html) numbers:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```
